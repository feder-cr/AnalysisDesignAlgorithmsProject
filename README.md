University project of the course "ANALISI E PROGETTAZIONE DI ALGORITMI" of the computer science university of Genoa. The course was divided into two modules:

## Module 1: Techniques, Graphs and NP-Completeness

In this module I studied:

- Asymptotic notations (Big O, Omega, Theta) and analysis of algorithms complexity
- Recurrence relations and substitutions method
- Proof of correctness of recursive and iterative algorithms
- Graph algorithms: representations, visits, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, topological sorting, strongly connected components
- Dynamic programming, Longest Common Subsequence, Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- NP-completeness theory: decision problems, NP class, polynomial time reduction, examples of reductions

## Module 2: Randomized Algorithms  

In this module I learned about:

- Las Vegas algorithms: sorting, linear programming, game tree evaluation
- Monte Carlo algorithms: minimum cut, distributed consensus, primality testing, equality verification
- Connections with Game Theory

## Course Labs and Assignments

This project includes code I wrote for course assignments and labs:

- Byzantine fault
- Implementations of classic graph algorithms and dynamic programming solutions 
- Experimental analysis of sorting algorithms complexity
- Applying randomized techniques for primality testing and distributed consensus

Specifically, the labs covered:


**Lab 2.1:** Las Vegas algorithm for Quicksort 

**Lab 8.1:** Millerâ€“Rabin primality test

**What I Learned**

By completing this course, I strengthened my skills in algorithms analysis, design and implementation using various techniques. I gained solid knowledge of fundamental graph algorithms, dynamic programming, randomized methods and complexity theory that provide a base for advanced computer science topics.
